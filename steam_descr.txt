[b]Summary[/b]
Populum (latin for [i]People[/i]) mod's goal is to link all the classes together in a thematic story-like fashion based loosely on French and Raven's Five Forms of Power and systems of government connecting to social, political, and economic attributes. Populum increases the depth of the economy management and expands the early and late game of the classes by introducing new options. You will find that many commander units especially spell-casters will have some ritual powers and in some circumstances may be able to change into other classes or units.

The classes have been re-flavored based on government types. Most of the classes can be thought of as paths branching away from the Monarchy(Baron), Republic(Senator), Minarchy(Witch) and other secondary classes pathing into even more niche variants. In some instances there may not be a path back from some classes without capturing a terrain tile that permits a person on a particular path. The traditional class recruitment is minimal in Populum except for NPC classes. Recruitment is predominately through various ritual powers that people have. Recruitment offers depend on having certain people at certain locations. Not every class has been expanded and connected, especially newer classes released in COE5. This is a work in progress.

Some classes are meant for the AI only and are tagged with an "(NPC)" at the end of the class name. I would not recommend using these NPC classes because they are designed to be played by the AI with significant bonuses. These classes include: Goblin Emperor, Slave King, Independent Town, Bandit King, and the boss class called "Blood Tide" which you may only have one due to the unique boss that comes with it. These classes were designed with the intent to be difficult early game enemies and mere nuisance to late-game players. The NPC classes are useful to quickly add flavor to a generated map. The NPC classes have their recommended difficulty built into the class name and are designed for the largest map size (enormous or custom larger). You may want to decrease an NPCs difficulty by one for 1-2 map size class reductions. For example the Goblin Emperor on enormous+ is played on Emperor difficulty; reduce to King for a Huge map, Duke for Large, Marquis for Medium, and anything smaller set to Count. 

A short list of changes:
 - About 800 new rituals.
 - About 900 new units / variants.
 - Redesigned economy with unit upkeep and scaled income by ekistics (population).
 - Redesigned and rebalanced combat mechanics, e.g.: large and huge weapons with reach and differentiated bows with longer range.
 - Craft many items through rituals.
 - More units have special terrain stealth.
 - More terrain movement variation between units.
 - Smoothed and reduced the movement cost of many terrains.
 - Less inherent vision, more use for scouting and stealth.
 - More options to traverse water and faster water movement. Many water units will change into a watershape that floats on water allowing faster movement.
 - More immortality options.
 - Overall increased hitpoint levels for lower hp units, and less or none for high hp units
 - Shields provide airshield effect
 - Mounts will regain on certain terrains linked to the mount. For example, unicorns riders can regain their mount in ancient forests and sacred groves only. Typical human horse mounts can be acquired in village sized settlements or larger. Hoburgers gain mounts inside their settlements.
 - Other mass rebalances; for example some units such as undead are immune to decay effects in Populum, most mounted units will lose their mount after taking damage.

If you would like to play more freely then I would recommend you enable the CHEAT module. It comes with a teleporting "Director Tool" that also gives first player on list many resources.
[i]Note: You need to have both populum.c5m and popCHEAT.c5m activated at same time on.[/i]

[b]Custom Maps[/b]
The Game of Thrones map (GOT) is a fixed starting location map due to the density of resources and lots of geographic choke-points. Thanks to Wankovich for porting from COE4 to COE5.[/url]

[b]Known quirks:[/b]
> Immortality is tied to the plane the monster becomes immortal. Dieing on another plane will result in permanent death.

[b]Technical Note:[/b]
[i]Populum's turn processing time should be more reasonable than previous versions given the reduction and removal of many events. Multiplayer games should always be hosted on the best CPU.[/i]
